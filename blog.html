						<p class="post-title"> First post </p>
						<p class="post-content">  This first post is about the launch of this website. While this particular domain has been host to a few other drafts before this rebuild, the expectation from now on is that the face of this website will continue to change in relation to the tech used to build it - as my skills and experience grow - but will remain with the goals expressed thus far. The goal is to host interesting things that I learn which will be helpful to someone out there. I have no intention to discuss or present anything else here. My personal aim isn't to just be a web developer but to be an engineer first and foremost so building websites shall only be a chapter of the book I wish to be. I hope to one day use my experience building (with) technologies to build physical things like, say, robotic constructions.</p>

						<p class="post-title"> My first lesson after this launch</p>
						<p class="post-content">Straight after launching this, my goal was to make use of a book I recently got a hold of - on MERN stack. I wanted to take the next step towards exploring backend, but I also heavily felt like I was neglecting my strong interest in C# and Dotnet development. I also have a book ASP.Net Core but the book was too abstract so I stalled in reading it. Thankfully, I had a conversation with a dotnet developer that pretty much freed me from having to choose between the two books to study. What he said was that ASP.NET development particularly web dev requires knowledge of frameworks like React, so I could just learn them together. As such I have been busy learning ASP.NET CORE web dev for the past few days. This is one of the reasons why I think having mentors is very important. When you become confused and disillusioned, they can shine a light on an appropriate path for you, and you become relieved. 
						<br><br>
						Moving onto the actual point of this post, what did I learn? That there's a world of wonder at the feet of ASP.NET Core. I was worried about how I will update this website. But having now seen how APIs are at play in many website or services over the internet, I now have an idea on how I can update the blog posts on here without having to touch the website's structure at all. I am thinking of build an ASP.NET Core version of this website, this webpage in particular, and use APIs to handle updating the blog posts. With that, I don't have to see a single line of code, just a Postman HTTP Post/Put will suffice to update it.<br></p>
