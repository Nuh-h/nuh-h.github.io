			  <h3> Brief Q'n'A </h3>
			  <ul title="Click to expand/collapse">
				<li class="question" tabindex="0"><span> >  </span> Who am I? </li>
				<li class="answer"> I am originally a nomad, and now I am  an adventurer both in the digital and physical world. </li>

				<li class="question" tabindex="0"><span> > </span> What is up with this website? </li>
				<li class="answer"> The original intention was to practise and experiment with HTML/CSS/JS, and while this remains to be the case, the intention now is to gear it towards being the place to host stories of my adventures in the tech world. There are many ideas, and projects I hope to tinker with so this will be a good space to share them.</li>

				<li class="question" tabindex="0"> <span> > </span> One thing I learnt so far? </li>
				<li class="answer"> Accessibility is one area which I never quite knew anything about but has begun to interest me strongly, and I guess it is just about trying to do the right thing.  I used to spend some seconds testing the limits of interactivity in apps and websites, because I noticed how very much realistic/intuitive the interactions were. I appreciate them a lot more now, knowing exactly the kind of effort that went into them. </li>
